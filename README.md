# **Race Bug Game**

**Race Bug** is a simple and fun arcade-style game built using **Pygame**, a popular Python library for creating games. In this game, you control a bug (the "Race Bug") and try to dodge incoming obstacles. The longer you survive, the higher your score! But be carefulâ€”crashing into an obstacle will end the game.

This game is perfect for beginners who want to explore game development with Python and Pygame. Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to understand, and a great way to get started with creating your own games!
